Disabling Your Account anonymizes Your Content but does not automatically remove it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> &bull;</span><span> You may delete certain types of Your Content via the Drinkspottings website, but because other Drinkspottings users may have acted on Your Content (for example, bookmarking a drink you recommended), you may not be able to remove or edit Your Content entirely once you’ve contributed it to Drinkspottings.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> &bull;</span><span> We reserve the right to monitor and review Your Account, Your Content and Your activity for compliance with these Terms of Service.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> &bull;</span><span> We reserve the right to remove or disable Your Account or Your Content for any reason, including, but not limited to, violation of Terms of Service, alleged infringement or verbal, physical, written or other abuse of a Drinkspottings user, employee, member or officer.
