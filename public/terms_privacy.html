	•	You are responsible for creating a secure password and protecting Your Account from unauthorized access.

Contributing Content
	•	By choosing to contribute Your Content to Drinkspottings, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms and our Privacy Policy. You should only contribute Content to Drinkspottings if you are comfortable with these terms.

Drinkspottings will not be responsible or liable for any use of Your Content by Drinkspottings in accordance with these Terms of Service. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.
	•	You will be held solely responsible and liable for Your Content and conduct on the Drinkspottings Service.
	•	Your Content will be publicly visible throughout the Drinkspottings Service.
	•	Your Content, including your public account information such as your display name or profile picture, may be indexed by third party search engines, such as Google, which may not remove it immediately (or ever), even if it is removed from the Drinkspottings Service.
	•	Your Content may be licensed to third parties who have agreed to theTerms of Service, or otherwise licensed it from Drinkspottings, as described in our Privacy Policy.
	•	Your Content may be modified or adapted (for example, photos may be cropped) in order to meet design and technical requirements of the Service or for any other reason.
	•	You are responsible for retaining original copies of Your Content.
	•	Because other Drinkspottings users may have acted on Your Content (for example, bookmarking a drink you recommended), you may not be able to remove or edit Your Content once you’ve contributed it to Drinkspottings. We have made reasonable efforts to enable you to delete Your Content and disable Your Account, which disassociates Your Content from Your Account, but we cannot guarantee complete removal.
	•	Your Content always belongs to you. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Your Content, but by uploading, posting, contributing, or otherwise providing Your Content to Drinkspottings, you grant Drinkspottings a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit Your Content in connection with the Service and Drinkspottings’s (and its successors’ and assigns’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) or the Service in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party services).
	•	For clarity, the foregoing license grant to Drinkspottings does not affect your other ownership or license rights in Your Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to the material in Your Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
	•	We will encourage any third parties to whom we sublicense Your Content to attribute you, in addition to Drinkspottings, but you acknowledge that this may not always be possible depending on the context.
	•	Be sure to review our Privacy Policy to better understand how your public and private information is used and protected.
Removal of Your Account and Your Content
	•	You may disable Your Account via the Drinkspottings website. If you disable Your Account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to stop displaying any public Account information (such as your Display Name) throughout the Service. Disabling Your Account anonymizes Your Content but does not automatically remove it.
	•	You may delete certain types of Your Content via the Drinkspottings website, but because other Drinkspottings users may have acted on Your Content (for example, bookmarking a drink you recommended), you may not be able to remove or edit Your Content entirely once you’ve contributed it to Drinkspottings.
	•	We reserve the right to monitor and review Your Account, Your Content and Your activity for compliance with these Terms of Service.
	•	We reserve the right to remove or disable Your Account or Your Content for any reason, including, but not limited to, violation of Terms of Service, alleged infringement or verbal, physical, written or other abuse of a Drinkspottings user, employee, member or officer. Doing so could immediately prevent you from accessing Your Account, Your Content or the Service.
	•	We will do our best to communicate with you via Your Account email address prior to removal of Your Account or Your Content, but are not obligated to do so and cannot be responsible for failure to reach you via email.
	•	We cannot guarantee access to Your Account or Your Content.
	•	We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content. You are responsible for backing up and archiving Your Content.

Dispute Resolution
A printed version of the Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  You and Drinkspottings agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America.  Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York County, New York, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith.  Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.  For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Southern District Court of New York. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, this section.
YOU AND Drinkspottings AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Drinkspottings AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
Integration and Severability
The Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and Drinkspottings with respect to the Service and use of the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Drinkspottings with respect to the Services.  If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. 
Miscellaneous
Drinkspottings shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Drinkspottings’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.  The Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Drinkspottings’s prior written consent.  Drinkspottings may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Service, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.  All notices under the Terms of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.

If you log in using a third party service such as Facebook, the email address that you used to register with that third party service will be used to create your Account, including the password that you use for that Account. Passwords are stored using industry standard methods. Your actual password is never stored or visible to Drinkspottings, its agents or employees at any time. Your email address will never be displayed to other users of the Service (unless you separately include it in any public information you provide, which we do not recommend).
	•	Third Party Connections: In order to facilitate sharing of information between services and find friends who have registered for Drinkspottings, you can connect third party services (such as Facebook and Twitter) using the secure, industry standard connection methods provided by these third parties. When you make a connection between your Drinkspottings account and one of these third party services, the third party service may share certain information about you with Drinkspottings.  These third parties never reveal your passwords to us and are responsible for informing you about what information they will share with Drinkspottings. We will never post content to your third party profiles unless you’ve chosen to enable us to do so by accepting the appropriate request for permission, checking a box or taking some other explicit action.
	•	Payment Information: We do not directly collect or store any payment information at this time, but may use third party services such as PayPal or Goodsie to enable you to purchase Drinkspottings-related products or services. These Terms of Service do not cover third parties’ handling of Personal Information, so if you use these third party services, be sure to review their terms of service and privacy policies. 
	•	Your Contacts: In order to find friends who have registered for Drinkspottings, you can optionally upload contact information from your mobile device by using the Find Contacts feature (if provided) and accepting the appropriate request for permission or prompt.

Only your Public Information will ever be visible to other users, however, even if they know your email address.
How will you use cookies?
As described above, we occasionally create “cookies”—bits of alphanumeric information that are stored by your browser or mobile device—in order to identify your browser or mobile device. These cookies are like “breadcrumbs” left behind by the Service to remind us that you’ve used it before so that we can improve your experience. By using Drinkspottings, you agree to let us create cookies that enable us to do things like:
	•	Keep you logged into Drinkspottings so that you don’t have to log in again every time you close your browser.
	•	Remember the last location you entered on Drinkspottings so that you don’t have to enter your location again and again.
	•	Display announcements when you first visit Drinkspottings but not every time you visit.
	•	Remember certain preferences you might set.
	•	Collect usage information for statistical purposes as described above.
Additionally, we may integrate third party services—such as the Facebook “Like” button—which may create their own cookies in order to personalize your experience, but this policy only covers the use of cookies by Drinkspottings. Cookies placed by third party services are governed by the third party terms and privacy policies applicable to those services (which we encourage you to read).
Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies altogether, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to enjoy a less frustrating, more personalized experience. Certain features of the Service may not work at all if cookies are disabled.
HOW DO YOU PROTECT MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Personal Information is transmitted to and stored by Drinkspottings using industry-standard methods for each type of information. Our databases and servers are protected from unauthorized access using modern security and authentication methods such as passwords and access keys.
No method of transmitting or storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, however. While we endeavor to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that it will not be viewed, tampered with or intercepted by an unauthorized third party. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your Personal Information.
We will notify you by email if we have reason to believe that your Personal Information has been compromised due to a security breach or used in an unauthorized manner, but by using this Service, you agree to release us from any and all claims arising out of unauthorized use of your information.
Per our Terms of Service, you are ultimately the one responsible for ensuring the safety of your Personal Information by taking measures including, but not limited to:
	•	Keeping your email address and password safe
	•	Creating strong passwords and using them wisely (e.g.. don’t use the same password for Drinkspottings and your bank, for example)
	•	Making sure that any internet connection you’re using to access the Service is secure and trusted
	•	Only uploading photos and other Public Information if you are comfortable with it being public

When navigating to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site.  This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Service.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU CHANGE THIS POLICY?
Drinkspottings may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes to the way we use Personal Information or material changes to this policy, we will notify you by delivering an announcement via our Service or your Account email address. If you opt out of communications from Drinkspottings, you may not receive these notifications, however they will still govern your use of the Service, and you are responsible for proactively checking for any changes.
