We have made reasonable efforts to enable you to delete Your Content and disable Your Account, which disassociates Your Content from Your Account, but we cannot guarantee complete removal. 	•	Your Content always belongs to you. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Your Content, but by uploading, posting, contributing, or otherwise providing Your Content to Drinkspottings, you grant Drinkspottings a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit Your Content in connection with the Service and Drinkspottings’s (and its successors’ and assigns’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) or the Service in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party services). 	•	For clarity, the foregoing license grant to Drinkspottings does not affect your other ownership or license rights in Your Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to the material in Your Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. 	•	We will encourage any third parties to whom we sublicense Your Content to attribute you, in addition to Drinkspottings, but you acknowledge that this may not always be possible depending on the context. 	•	Be sure to review our Privacy Policy to better understand how your public and private information is used and protected.Removal of Your Account and Your Content	•	You may disable Your Account via the Drinkspottings website. If you disable Your Account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to stop displaying any public Account information (such as your Display Name) throughout the Service. Disabling Your Account anonymizes Your Content but does not automatically remove it. 	•	You may delete certain types of Your Content via the Drinkspottings website, but because other Drinkspottings users may have acted on Your Content (for example, bookmarking a drink you recommended), you may not be able to remove or edit Your Content entirely once you’ve contributed it to Drinkspottings. 	•	We reserve the right to monitor and review Your Account, Your Content and Your activity for compliance with these Terms of Service. 	•	We reserve the right to remove or disable Your Account or Your Content for any reason, including, but not limited to, violation of Terms of Service, alleged infringement or verbal, physical, written or other abuse of a Drinkspottings user, employee, member or officer. Doing so could immediately prevent you from accessing Your Account, Your Content or the Service. 	•	We will do our best to communicate with you via Your Account email address prior to removal of Your Account or Your Content, but are not obligated to do so and cannot be responsible for failure to reach you via email. 	•	We cannot guarantee access to Your Account or Your Content. 	•	We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content. You are responsible for backing up and archiving Your Content. 	•	We reserve the right to reclaim any username created by a Drinkspottings user on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on that username. 	•	We also reserve the right to reclaim any username created by a Drinkspottings user that has been inactive for 6 months or more.

Dispute Resolution A printed version of the Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  You and Drinkspottings agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America.  Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York County, New York, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Integration and Severability The Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and Drinkspottings with respect to the Service and use of the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Drinkspottings with respect to the Services.  If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  Miscellaneous Drinkspottings shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Drinkspottings’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.  The Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Drinkspottings’s prior written consent.  Drinkspottings may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Service, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.  All notices under the Terms of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.
